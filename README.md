#Airports (Arcitect Challenge) 
This was the test set at the end of our third week at Makers Academy and it followed on from the Boris Bikes project which we did during the week that introuduced us to OOP and OOD. We were told to imagine that we were writing software to control the flow of planes at an airport. We also had to consider the weather, this would normally be sunny but at times stormy and at these times no plane could take off and land. Every plane had to have a status to indicate if it was flying or landing. This was my first attempt at the challenge. The challenge was set by our coach at Makers, Enrique Comba Riepenhausen
